## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r load libraries}
library(tidyverse)
library(ggmap)
library(lubridate)
library(ggplot2)
library(data.table)
library(ggrepel)
library(dplyr)
library(scales)
```

```{r load data}
data = read.csv("ABIA.csv")
codes = read.csv("airport-codes.csv")
attach(data)
```

```{r get airport codes and important info}
#grab important info from codes file
codes_crop = codes[,10:12]
codes_crop = codes_crop[,c(1,3)]
codes_crop = distinct(codes_crop, codes_crop$iata_code,.keep_all=TRUE)
#merge for destination coords
data2 = merge(data,codes_crop,by.x=("Dest"),by.y=("iata_code"),all.x=TRUE)
data2 = data2[,-31]
names(data2)[30] = "dest_coord"
#merge for origin coords
data2 = merge(data2,codes_crop,by.x=("Origin"),by.y=("iata_code"),all.x=TRUE)
data2 = data2[,-32]
names(data2)[31] = "origin_coord"
#split coords into long and lat
data3 = separate(data2, dest_coord,c("dest_lat","dest_long"),
                 sep = ",",remove=FALSE)
data3 = separate(data3, origin_coord,c("origin_lat","origin_long"),
                 sep = ",",remove=FALSE)
```

The below plots are created by first subsetting the dataset to focus on flights departing from the Austin airport. These destinations are then plotted on a map of the US with the size of the marker reflecting the amount of flights to that location. Markers are then colored based on the average delay time of flights to those locations on a blue/red scale. This final plot could be helpful for Austinites that travel frequently and are curious about flight patterns for their destination.


```{r Austin focus}
#Subset data to Austin departures
aus = data3[which(data3$Origin=="AUS"),]

#How many destinations from aus?
length(unique(aus$Dest)) #52 different locations

#Groupby locations and get count of flights
grouped = summarize(group_by(aus,Dest,dest_long,dest_lat),count=n())
grouped$count = as.numeric(grouped$count)
grouped$dest_long = as.numeric(as.character(grouped$dest_long))
grouped$dest_lat = as.numeric(as.character(grouped$dest_lat))
```

```{r plot and layer}
#Plot USA map
usa_bb = c(-124.848974, 24.396308, -66.885444, 49.384358)
usa_map = ggmap(get_stamenmap(bbox=usa_bb, scale=2, zoom=5,
                              maptype = "terrain"), extent="normal")

#Layer AUS destinations with size as number of flights
#scale down circle sizes to fit on map
circle_scale_amt = 0.0035
#plot
usa_map + 
  geom_point(aes(x = dest_long, y = dest_lat),data=grouped, 
                          col= "orange",alpha=.6,size = grouped$count*circle_scale_amt)+
               scale_size_continuous(range=c(1,5573))
```

```{r color by mean delay}
#get delays
grouped2 = summarize(group_by(aus,Dest,dest_long,dest_lat), count= n(),
                     delay = mean(ArrDelay, na.rm = T))
grouped2$count = as.numeric(grouped2$count)
grouped2$dest_long = as.numeric(as.character(grouped2$dest_long))
grouped2$dest_lat = as.numeric(as.character(grouped2$dest_lat))

#scale delay so that all positive values (for graphing purposes)
grouped2$scdelay = as.numeric(rescale(grouped2$delay))
grouped2 = grouped2[-39,]

#build plot, where darker = higher avg delays
usa_map + 
  geom_point(aes(x = dest_long, y = dest_lat,col= grouped2$scdelay),data=grouped2, 
             alpha=.6,size = grouped2$count*circle_scale_amt)+
  scale_size_continuous(range=c(1,5573))+
  scale_color_gradient(low="blue",high="red",limits=c(0,.25)) +
  labs(title = "Flights and Delays out of AUS", 
       subtitle = "Flights out of AUS to US destinations, where the size reflects
       the # of flights, and the color reflects the mean delay",
       x= "Longitude",y="Latitude",colour="Mean Delay (scaled)")
```

In summary we see that flights from AUS to ATL are typically delayed longer than flights to other locations. On the other hand, flights to Miami are great (for more than one reason, I'd say). These results are not incredibly surprising because ATL is a huge airport hosting thousands of flights, and is more susceptible to regular and weather delays than Miami. In addition, it is not surprising that a majority of flights out of AUS are to Dallas and Houston - I would assume that this is largely due to business travel.
